## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-emotion-recognition.git
   cd face-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

### Deployment Options

#### Streamlit Cloud
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Deploy with one click

#### Python Anywhere
1. Upload your files to Python Anywhere
2. Set up a web app with Python 3.7+
3. Install requirements: `python -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure WSGI file to run Streamlit

#### Heroku
1. Create a `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: sh setup.sh && streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0
   ```
2. Create `setup.sh`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
   echo "\
   [general]\n\
   email = \"your-email@domain.com\"\n\
   " > ~/.streamlit/credentials.toml
   echo "\
   [server]\n\
   headless = true\n\
   enableCORS=false\n\
   port = $PORT\n\
   " > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
   ```

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Navigate to the Analyze tab** in the application
2. **Upload an image** using the file uploader
3. **Click "Analyze Emotion"** to start the AI analysis
4. **View detailed results** including emotion, confidence, and probabilities

### Best Practices for Optimal Results
- Use high-resolution images with good lighting
- Ensure faces are clearly visible and unobstructed
- Front-facing or slightly angled faces work best
- Avoid heavily shadowed or blurry images

### Supported File Formats
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP
- Maximum file size: 10MB
